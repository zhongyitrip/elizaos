            **🚨 CRITICAL CHECKS:**
            - Security: hardcoded keys, SQL injection, XSS
            - No tests = REJECT (untested code is broken)
            - Wrong tools: npm/pnpm/yarn/jest/vitest = REJECT
            - Breaking changes without migration = REJECT

            **✅ REQUIRED:**
            - TypeScript types (no 'any')
            - Tests with bun test ONLY
            - Use @elizaos/core imports (not packages/core)
            - Functional code (no classes)
            - Error handling

            **📋 VERIFY:**
            - All new code has tests
            - bun commands only in package.json
            - No circular dependencies
            - Follows existing patterns
            - Docs updated if needed

            **🎯 OUTPUT FORMAT:**
